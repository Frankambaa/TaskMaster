# Practical Examples - How the AI Tool System Works

## Code Examples with Real Flow

### Example 1: Single Word Query - "credits"

```python
# 1. Pre-filtering Check
question = "credits"
question_lower = question.lower().strip()  # "credits"
question_words = question.split()  # ["credits"]

# Check 1: Multiple tools? ✓ Yes (2 tools available)
# Check 2: Question length > 5? ✗ No (1 word)
# Check 3: Contains action words? ✗ No action words
# Check 4: Contains ambiguous keywords? ✓ Yes ("credits" in ambiguous_keywords)

# Result: Proceed to clarification check

# 2. Clarification AI Analysis
clarification_prompt = """
You are a conservative assistant that only asks for clarification when a question is EXTREMELY ambiguous.

Available tools:
- get_user_token: Get user's credit balance
- purchase_credits: Buy more credits

User question: credits
"""

# AI Response: "CLARIFICATION_NEEDED: Are you looking for your current credit balance or information about purchasing credits?"

# 3. Final Response
return "Are you looking for your current credit balance or information about purchasing credits?"
```

### Example 2: Clear Context Query - "Can I get my credit limit"

```python
# 1. Pre-filtering Check
question = "Can I get my credit limit"
question_lower = question.lower().strip()  # "can i get my credit limit"
question_words = question.split()  # ["Can", "I", "get", "my", "credit", "limit"]

# Check 1: Multiple tools? ✓ Yes
# Check 2: Question length > 5? ✓ Yes (6 words) → Skip clarification
# Check 3: Contains action words? ✓ Yes ("can", "get") → Skip clarification

# Result: Skip clarification, proceed to tool selection

# 2. Tool Selection AI Analysis
tool_selection_prompt = """
You are a conservative AI assistant that only uses API tools when ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN.

Available tools:
- get_user_token: Get user's credit balance and token information

User question: Can I get my credit limit
Conversation history: [...previous messages...]
"""

# AI Decision: Use get_user_token (matches exactly - user wants their credit information)

# 3. Tool Execution
curl_command = "curl -X POST https://api.example.com/user/token"
api_response = {"status": 200, "Token": "300"}

# 4. Response Formatting
formatted_response = "Based on the API response, here's your information:\n\n- **TOKEN**: 300\n\nLet me know if you need any additional details!"

# 5. Final Response
return formatted_response
```

### Example 3: Non-API Query - "How can I post my job"

```python
# 1. Pre-filtering Check
question = "How can I post my job"
question_lower = question.lower().strip()  # "how can i post my job"
question_words = question.split()  # ["How", "can", "I", "post", "my", "job"]

# Check 1: Multiple tools? ✓ Yes
# Check 2: Question length > 5? ✓ Yes (6 words) → Skip clarification
# Check 3: Contains action words? ✓ Yes ("how", "can", "post") → Skip clarification

# Result: Skip clarification, proceed to tool selection

# 2. Tool Selection AI Analysis
tool_selection_prompt = """
You are a conservative AI assistant that only uses API tools when ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN.

Available tools:
- get_user_token: Get user's credit balance and token information

User question: How can I post my job
"""

# AI Decision: No tool matches - this is asking for instructions, not personal data
# Response: Don't use any tools, fall back to knowledge base

# 3. RAG Knowledge Base Processing
# System searches document chunks for job posting information
# Generates response using conversation memory + document context

# 4. Final Response
return "To post a job, you can follow these steps: [information from knowledge base]..."
```

### Pre-filtering Implementation

```python
def check_for_clarification_needed(self, question: str, tools: List[Dict]) -> Optional[str]:
    try:
        # Only check for clarification if we have multiple tools
        if len(tools) < 2:
            return None
        
        # Pre-filter: Only check if question is potentially ambiguous
        question_lower = question.lower().strip()
        
        # Common ambiguous keywords
        ambiguous_keywords = [
            'credits', 'credit', 'account', 'balance', 'status', 'info', 
            'information', 'details', 'data', 'token', 'tokens', 'user', 
            'profile', 'settings'
        ]
        
        # Skip clarification if question is long or contains action words
        if len(question.split()) > 5 or any(word in question_lower for word in [
            'how', 'what', 'where', 'when', 'why', 'can', 'could', 'should', 
            'would', 'help', 'show', 'get', 'find', 'search', 'post', 'create', 
            'update', 'delete'
        ]):
            return None
        
        # Only proceed if question contains ambiguous keywords
        if not any(keyword in question_lower for keyword in ambiguous_keywords):
            return None
        
        # Send to AI for clarification analysis
        # ... AI processing logic ...
        
        return clarification_question_or_none
```

### Tool Selection Implementation

```python
def should_use_tools(self, question: str, conversation_history: List[Dict] = None):
    # First check for clarification
    clarification = self.check_for_clarification_needed(question, tools)
    if clarification:
        return False, None, None, clarification
    
    # Build conservative system prompt
    messages = [
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": """You are a conservative AI assistant that only uses API tools when ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Only use API tools when the user's question DIRECTLY and SPECIFICALLY requests information that can ONLY be obtained from the API
2. If the question is vague, general, or could be answered with general knowledge, DO NOT use any tools
3. If you're unsure whether to use a tool, DON'T use it - default to general knowledge
4. Look for EXACT matches between the user's request and the tool's purpose

Examples of when TO use tools:
- "What is my current credit limit" (directly asking for personal account data)
- "Show me my account balance" (directly requesting personal information)

Examples of when NOT to use tools:
- "How do I get more credits" (asking for instructions, not current status)
- "Can you share your plan to buy credits" (asking about purchasing plans)
"""
        }
    ]
    
    # Add conversation history and user question
    if conversation_history:
        messages.extend(conversation_history[-5:])
    messages.append({"role": "user", "content": question})
    
    # Call OpenAI with function calling
    response = self.openai_client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        messages=messages,
        tools=tools,
        tool_choice="auto"
    )
    
    # Process response
    message = response.choices[0].message
    if message.tool_calls:
        tool_call = message.tool_calls[0]
        return True, tool_call.function.name, json.loads(tool_call.function.arguments), None
    
    return False, None, None, None
```
