# Zero-Touch Automated Deployment

Complete automation for your RAG Chatbot with **zero manual intervention** after initial setup.

## 🚀 Three Deployment Options

### Option 1: Webhook-Based Auto-Deploy (Recommended)
**Best for**: Instant deployment on code push
**Setup Time**: 15 minutes one-time
**Maintenance**: Zero

```bash
# One-time setup
chmod +x deployment/auto-deploy.sh
./deployment/auto-deploy.sh
```

**What it does:**
- Sets up GitHub webhook listener
- Automatically deploys when you push to main branch
- No manual code upload ever needed
- Health checks and rollback on failure
- Email notifications on deployment status

### Option 2: GitHub Actions
**Best for**: Enterprise-grade CI/CD
**Setup Time**: 5 minutes one-time
**Maintenance**: Zero

```bash
# 1. Copy .github/workflows/deploy.yml to your repo
# 2. Add secrets to GitHub repo settings
# 3. Push code - automatic deployment!
```

### Option 3: Docker Auto-Update
**Best for**: Container-based updates
**Setup Time**: 10 minutes one-time
**Maintenance**: Zero

```bash
# Uses Watchtower for automatic container updates
docker-compose -f deployment/docker-auto-deploy.yml up -d
```

## 🔧 Complete Setup Process

### Step 1: Initial Server Setup (One-Time)
```bash
# Launch EC2 instance
# Connect via SSH
# Run automated setup
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/deployment/auto-deploy.sh | bash
```

### Step 2: Configure GitHub Webhook (One-Time)
```bash
# Script will provide webhook URL and secret
# Add to GitHub repo settings > Webhooks
# Payload URL: http://your-server-ip:9000/webhook
# Content type: application/json
# Secret: [provided by script]
```

### Step 3: Deploy Code (Automated)
```bash
# Just push code to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Update application"
git push origin main

# Automatic deployment happens in background
# Check deployment logs: tail -f /opt/rag-chatbot/logs/deployment.log
```

## 🔄 Automated Deployment Flow

```
Developer pushes code to GitHub
         ↓
GitHub sends webhook to server
         ↓
Webhook listener receives payload
         ↓
Validates webhook signature
         ↓
Executes deployment script
         ↓
Pulls latest code from GitHub
         ↓
Builds new Docker containers
         ↓
Stops old containers
         ↓
Starts new containers
         ↓

```

## 📊 Monitoring & Logs

### Deployment Logs
```bash
# Real-time deployment logs
tail -f /opt/rag-chatbot/logs/deployment.log

# Webhook activity logs
tail -f /opt/rag-chatbot/logs/webhook-access.log

# Application logs
docker-compose logs -f app
```

### Health Monitoring
```bash
# Built-in health check endpoint
curl http://your-server/health

# Container status
docker-compose ps

# System resources
htop
```

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Webhook Security
- SHA256 signature verification
- Secret key validation
- IP address filtering (optional)
- Rate limiting protection

### Deployment Security
- Isolated Docker containers
- Non-root user execution
- Firewall protection
- SSL/TLS encryption

## 🚨 Rollback & Recovery

### Automatic Rollback
```bash
# If health check fails, previous version is restored
# Rollback logs are saved automatically
# Email notifications sent on failures
```

### Manual Rollback
```bash
# Rollback to previous version
cd /opt/rag-chatbot
git reset --hard HEAD~1
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

## 📈 Scaling Automation

### Auto-Scaling Setup
```bash
# Configure auto-scaling group
# Health check endpoints
# Load balancer integration
# Database connection pooling
```

### Multi-Environment Support
```bash
# Separate webhooks for staging/production
# Environment-specific deployment scripts
# Automated testing before production
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Webhook not triggering**
   ```bash
   # Check webhook logs
   tail -f /opt/rag-chatbot/logs/webhook-access.log
   
   # Verify webhook service
   sudo supervisorctl status webhook-listener
   ```

2. **Deployment failing**
   ```bash
   # Check deployment logs
   tail -f /opt/rag-chatbot/logs/deployment.log
   
   # Manual deployment
   cd /opt/rag-chatbot && ./deploy.sh
   ```

3. **Application not responding**
   ```bash
   # Check container status
   docker-compose ps
   
   # Restart containers
   docker-compose restart
   ```

### Log Locations
- Deployment: `/opt/rag-chatbot/logs/deployment.log`
- Webhook: `/opt/rag-chatbot/logs/webhook-access.log`
- Application: `docker-compose logs app`
- Nginx: `docker-compose logs nginx`
